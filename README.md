### First-person-shooter game

In the time of corona, I decided to play around with Unity's tutorials. I came across [the Creator Kit: FPS tutorial](https://learn.unity.com/project/creator-kit-fps)
and decided to make a coronavirus-based FPS, as the assets we already there to create a medicine-themed shooter. I am currently working on the second level, and maybe, will add more models via Blender.
